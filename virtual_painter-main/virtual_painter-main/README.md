# virtual painter
This project is about using openCV and mediapipe libraries   to utilize the webcam for drawing in real time.   
The main idea is:   
* detect hands using mediapipe
* detect whether the index and middle fingers are up
* detect fingers' tip location
* draw a line when only the index finger is up and make a selection when both index and middle fingers are up
